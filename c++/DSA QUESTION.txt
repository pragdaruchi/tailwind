24) OOPS - Object Oriented Programming System.

25)Principle of OOPS:
 1)Encapsulation
 2)Abstration
 3)Inheritance
 4)Polymorphism

26) Abstration Types:
1)Access Modifiers
 .Private
 .Public
 .Protected
2)Abstart class
3)Interface

27)Encapsulation Types:
   1)getter and setter
   2)destructor
   3)constructor 
   4)this keyword
   5)static keyword

28)inheritance Types:
     1)single
     2)multiple
     3)multilevel
     4)heirarichial
     5)hybrid

29)Polymorphism Types:
   1)method overloading
   2)method overridding
   3)operator overloading 

30)What is Data Encapsulation?
Ans)"Sensitive" data is hidden from users.

31)What is this Keyword?
Ans)pointers to the current instance of a class.

32)What is Array of Object?
Ans)Array of Object is a collection of object of the same class.

33)What is Scope Resolution Operator(::)?
Ans)Specify the context in which a particular identifier is defined.

34)Scope Resolution Operator Type?
1)Access Global variable
2)Access static Members

35)What is Static Keyword?
Ans)So Instance is not required to access the static members.

36)What is Constructor?
Ans)A Constructor is a special member function in a class that gets executed when a class when a class is instantiated.

37)Types of Constructor?
Ans)1.Default Constructor
    2.Parameterized Constructor
    3.Copy Constructor

38)Type Of Polymorphism : 1.Compile-time
                          2.Run-time

39)Compile Time:1.Method overloading
                2.Operator overloading

40)Run Time:1.method overriding

41)What is Static Memory Allocation?
Ans)Memory allocated during compile time is called static memory (Fixed).

42)Memory Structure Type:
    1.Heap
    2.Stack
    3.Code Section
    4.Data Section

43)What is Dynamic Memory Allocation?
Ans)The process of allocating memory at the time of executing is called dynamic Memory Allocation.

44)Heap Operator:
   1.new(C++)
   2.malloc(c)

45)C and C++ different :

            C                                    C++
      1.Dennis Ritchie created the        1.Bjarne Stroustreap created the 
        C language in the 1970s             C++ language in 1979.
       
     2.C doesnâ€™t support object-oriented  2.C++ support object-  
       programming (OOP).                   oriented programming (OOP).


46).How many types of Translator?
-> 1.Compiler :- Convert whole program into binary.
   2.Interpreter :- Convert line by line into binary.  

47)DRY-Don't Repeat Yourself.
